// This entity has responsibility for blocking the device from sleeping if
// certain behaviors (e.g. recording or playing voice messages) are in progress.
// 
// Sleep blocking is keyed using "block objects" whose lifetime corresponds to
// the duration of the block.  For example, sleep blocking during audio playback
// can be keyed to the audio player.  This provides a measure of robustness.
// On the one hand, we can use weak references to track block objects and stop
// blocking if the block object is deallocated even if removeBlock() is not
// called.  On the other hand, we will also get correct behavior to addBlock()
// being called twice with the same block object.
